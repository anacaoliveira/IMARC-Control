## Resources

Considering that not everyone have access to a Linux computer we will focus on using the ROS Toolbox within MATLAB. **The university offers a MATLAB license to all student** (in the same link you will find instructions on how to install it !): [https://its.uiowa.edu/matlab](https://its.uiowa.edu/matlab)

### ROS
Get Started with ROS: [https://www.mathworks.com/help/ros/ug/get-started-with-ros.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/ros/ug/get-started-with-ros.html)

More information about the ROS Toolbox: [https://www.mathworks.com/help/ros/index.html?s_tid=CRUX_lftnav](https://www.mathworks.com/help/ros/index.html?s_tid=CRUX_lftnav)

(ROS 2 or ROS 3?)

If ROS 2:
