## Resources
Considering that not everyone have access to a Linux computer we can use the ROS Toolbox within MATLAB. **The university offers a MATLAB license to all student** (in the same link you will find instructions on how to install it !): [https://its.uiowa.edu/matlab](https://its.uiowa.edu/matlab)

## VRX

Follow the tutorials to install the VRX simulation (https://github.com/osrf/vrx/wiki)

1. After instalation, build and run the VRX Platform

Source the ROS setup.bash file: 
```
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
```

Use catkin_make to build the software:
```
cd ~/vrx_ws
catkin_make
```

2. Run 
Source the created VRX setup.bash: 
```
source  ~/vrx_ws/devel/setup.bash
```
Launch the VRX simulation:
```
roslaunch vrx_gazebo sandisland.launch
```
This steps are necessary everytime you open a new terminal.
